## The Project

The Cancer Research UK funded Prostate ICGC project was [launched in 2011](https://ukicgcprostateanalysts.github.io/) with a view to analysing the genomes of 250 cancerous prostates in order to learn more about the molecular contribution to, and biomarkers of, the severity of the disease as well as adding to our knowledge of the biology and characterization of prostate cancer. Led out of The Royal Marsden, and ICR, the project was, from the outset, a collaboration between clinicians, biologists, pathologists and analysts (statisticians, epidemiologists, . Subsequent iterations of the project have seen more complex data sets being generated for the study cohort, with a corresponding increase in the complexity of required analyses.

## The Analysis Network

Over the lifetime of the project, there have naturally been changes within the analysis group, but the institutions currently involved include

* The University of East Anglia
* The Welcome Trust Sanger Centre
* The Institute of Cancer Research
* The University of St Andrews
* The University of Cambridge
* The University of Manchester
* The University of Oxford
